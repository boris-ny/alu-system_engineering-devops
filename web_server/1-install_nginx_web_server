# When querying Nginx at its root / with a GET request (requesting a page) using curl, it must return a page that contains the string Holberton School

# As an answer file, write a Bash script that configures a new Ubuntu machine to respect above requirements (this script will be run on the server itself)
# You canâ€™t use systemctl for restarting nginx
sudo service nginx restart # restart nginx using service command
